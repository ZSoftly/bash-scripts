# File Permissions in Linux / Unix:

 Linux is a clone of UNIX, the multi-user operating system which can be accessed by many users simultaneously. 
 Linux can also be used in mainframes and servers without any modifications. 
 But this raises security concerns as an unsolicited or malign user can corrupt, change or remove crucial data. 
 For effective security, Linux divides authorization into 2 levels.

   Ownership
   Permission
